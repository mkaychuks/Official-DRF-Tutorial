# Official Django Rest Framework Tutorial

This repo contains my code snippets learnt from the official DRF tutorial.
I used the simplified version summarized by William S.Vincent in his site, the link is https://wsvincent.com/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners-guide/

This worked me through the Pastebin API, teaching me about serializer relationships, permissions, custom permissions e.t.c. and would also serve as a reference to me, hopefully in the future..
